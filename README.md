# Abtract

Weakly-supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) has been considered as a more challenging task than weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Compared to WSSS, WSIS requires instance-wise localization, which is difficult to extract from image-level labels. To tackle the problem, most WSIS approaches use off-the-shelf proposal techniques that require pre-training with instance or object level labels, deviating the fundamental definition of the fully-image-level supervised setting. 
In this paper, we propose a novel approach including two innovative components. First, we propose a *semantic knowledge transfer* to obtain pseudo instance labels by transferring the knowledge of WSSS to WSIS while eliminating the need for the off-the-shelf proposals. Second, we propose a *self-refinement* method to refine the pseudo instance labels in a self-supervised scheme and to use the refined labels for training in an online manner. Here, we discover an erroneous phenomenon, *semantic drift*, that occurred by the missing instances in pseudo instance labels categorized as background class. This *semantic drift* occurs confusion between background and instance in training and consequently degrades the segmentation performance. We term this problem as *semantic drift problem* and show that our proposed *self-refinement* method eliminates the semantic drift problem.
The extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we achieve a considerable performance without off-the-shelf proposal techniques. The code is available at https://github.com/clovaai/BESTIE.
